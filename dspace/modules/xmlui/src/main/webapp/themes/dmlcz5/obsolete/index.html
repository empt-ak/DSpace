                                        Acta Universitatis Carolinae, Mathematica et Physica (abbr. AUC) was a periodic journal which appeared twice a year, containing altogether approx. 180 pages. It was designated for publication of papers written by members and guests of the Faculty Mathematics and Physics of Charles University. Special regard was given to research papers from mathematics and physics, but attractive survey papers were also accepted. The journal ceased publication in 2013, the last published issue being 2013/1.

The journal presented original papers in mathematics and physics as well as information on recent research progress and on events in national and foreign scientific life. Starting in 1872 the journal continued till 1950 ecxept of the forced interruption during the occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II. Since 1882 the journal contained a special supplement for high-school students. In 1951, the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences took over the journal and split it into two journals, Časopis pro pěstování matematiky (Journal for Cultivation of Mathematics) and Československý časopis pro fyziku (Czechoslovak Journal for Physics).

                                        Despite a new name, Communications in Mathematics is not a new publication – it has a 17 year tradition, being a continuation of the journal Acta Mathematica et Informatica Universitatis Ostraviensis, founded in 1993, and later published under the title Acta Mathematica Universitatis Ostraviensis (2003–2009). Communications in Mathematics publishes original research papers and survey papers in pure and applied mathematics, preferebly in the following areas: Number theory, Algebraic structures, Combinatorics, Cryptography, Differential geometry, Global analysis, Differential equations, Control and Optimization, Calculus of variations, Mathematical physics, Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory. To be acceptable for publication papers must make significant, original and correct contributions to one or more of the topics within these areas. High quality review papers of interest to a wide range of scientists in mathematics and its applications are equally welcome. The journal is reviewed in Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt MATH.

Since then it has been organized biannualy in different places in the Jizera Mountains in North Bohemia. The objective of this series of seminars is to provide a forum for presenting and discussing advanced topics in numerical analysis, computer implementation of algorithms, new approaches to mathematical modeling, and also multiprocessor applications of computational methods.

                                        The first Winter School in Abstract Analysis took place in 1973. It was founded by Zdeněk Frolík (1933–1989). This international School gained a popularity among the people interested in general topology, functional analysis, measure theory and combinatorics. Later the School was divided the into two sections, one from Analysis, the other from Topology. Some participants created later on an independent Winter School Geometry and Physics. The organizers ceased publishing WSAA proceedings in 2010.

                                        Winter School „Geometry and Physics“ arose inside the Winter School of Abstract Analysis. Geometry and Physics firstly emerged as a subsection of the section of topology in 1981 and since 1985 it became an independent international conference. The name of the schools was adjusted in the early years and stabilized at Geometry Physics. Since 1994 the the conference is supported by International Erwin Schrödinger Institute for Mathematical Physics in Vienna.

                                        Digitized book collection of the Czech mathematician and philosopher Bernard Placidus Johann Nepomuk Bolzano (1781-1848, Prague). From 1804 to 1817 Bolzano published several important mathematical works. In 1837 his "Wissenschaftslehre" appeared as an attempt to present a complete theory of science and knowledge. Approximately between 1830 and 1840 he worked on his major work "Grössenlehre" (remained unfinished). Around 1920 Martin Jašek discovered in Bolzano’s manuscripts an example of continuous nowhere differentiable functions. Bolzano’s work "Paradoxien des Unendlichen" was published three years after his death. His theories of mathematical infinity anticipated Cantor theory of sets. In addition to his mathematical work, Bolzano was also famous as a philosopher and as a logician.

The editors were Vítězslav Jozífek (1905-1983) a František Kahuda (1911-1987), it was printed in the Union's printing works Prometheus. The series was meant for students and wide public interested in mathematics and physics. The DML-CZ presents only volumes with mathematical subjects.

In his time he was one of the world's leading experts in topology and differential geometry and significantly contributed to the development of both fields. His scientific legacy includes more than one hundred original research papers and 14 monographs. In addition to these works, this digital archive presents also his numerous high school textbooks and other works for mathematics teaching, and also a collection of works about Eduard Čech himself, his life, work and achievements.

                                        Vojtěch Jarník (1897-1970) influenced by both his scientific work and his teacher’s activities several generations of Czech and Slovak mathematicians. He was an expert in traditional fields of mathematical analysis and also one of the first Czech mathematicians who mastered set theory and topology, measure theory and the theory of integral. His work comprises about 90 scientific papers devoted to problems of lattice points, Diophantine approximations and geometry of numbers, the theory of real functions and some other topics, and 10 textbooks on calculus, theory of integral and mathematical analysis. Digital Archive of Vojtěch Jarník presents the collection of his scientific works, texbooks, reviews etc. as well as the collection of works about him.
